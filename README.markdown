# Compass SASS Stylesheets
This is a repository to pull SASS style sheets on bower, and enjoy the compass mixins by using libsass for faster compilation. I made no modifications to the original stylesheets from the [original repository](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass.git)

# Compass Ruby Functions

This project includes reasonably similar implementations of some of the Ruby functions that Compass provides as Sass extensions. These are used in some Compass mixins, such as `@include background()`.

To make those functions available to your compass mixins, you'll want to import the included `_functions.scss` before `_compass.scss`.
