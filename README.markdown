# Compass SASS Stylesheets
This is a repository to pull SASS style sheets on bower, and enjoy the compass mixins by using libsass for faster compilation. I made no modifications to the original stylesheets from the [original repository](https://github.com/chriseppstein/compass.git)

Beware: This version doesn't use relative paths and may require you to properly configure the SASS compiler load paths
